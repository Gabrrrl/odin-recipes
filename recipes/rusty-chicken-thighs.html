        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 clove garlic, sliced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Asian chile pepper sauce (such as sambal oelek), or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 lime, cut into 8 wedges</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash garlic to a paste with a mortar and pestle. Mix chile pepper sauce, maple syrup, soy sauce,
                mayonnaise, and rice vinegar into garlic until marinade is thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken thighs to a large flat container (such as a baking dish) and pour marinade over
                chicken; stir until chicken is coated. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate about 3 hours; if
                preferred, let stand about 30 minutes at room temperature. Unwrap dish and sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat charcoal grill to high heat.</li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs onto the hot grill with smooth sides down. Cook until chicken shows grill marks,
                about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook until other side shows grill marks, about 5 minutes.
                Continue to cook, moving them occasionally and turning over every 2 minutes, until meat is no longer
                pink inside and the thighs are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a platter, let rest for 5 minutes, and serve garnished with lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
